FINAL PROJECT:
	This project draws a snowman using GLSL. It uses the concepts of shading and texture mapping. Its description is as follows:

1. This project uses the shapes of sphere, cone and quad. The coordinates of sphere and cone are exported from "Blender" software. The coordinates of quad are used from Lab6.

2. The quad is texture mapped by the image of smiley as given in Lab6.

3. All the cones are shaded using Phong shading. The material properties for all cones are kept same as in lab6 except for light source color which is changed to white.

4. Two sphere are used in which one of it is shaded using Flat shading and other is shaded using Gouraud shading. The material properties of sphere and the color of light source is changed in order to closely resemble it to snowman.

5. The two spheres are animated using rotation matrix.
